This project was developed for my college project 
It is built using Random-forest classification since it was giving the best result of 82% accuracy and also confirmed using Lazy Predict

It was built using 30,000 dataset found on kaggle competition
Unfortunately the kaggle competition is closed and not able to find it. I have attached the dataset as cred.csv file in repo



. Eventhough this project was my first project related to ML ,I had fun learning new intresting things related to ML
